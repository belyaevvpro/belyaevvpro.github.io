				So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas, colons, <strong>;</strong> and capitals
				and small letters.
				Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are colons and <strong>;</strong>, one might add to
				these commas.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go on but when
				I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if
				writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, what had periods to do with it what had small
				letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need
				I had in connection with writing. What had colons and <strong>;</strong> to do with it what had commas to do
				with
				it what had periods to do with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary
				ways,
				that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a
				little
				of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely
				a
				life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one's writing with
				them
				that is not really interrupt one's writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in
				one's
				writing and so they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they
				could
				come
				in this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and
				<strong>;</strong> do. Yes you do feel what I mean.You can see what an entirely different thing a period is
				from a comma,
				a colon or a <strong>;</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two different way of thinking about colons and <strong>;</strong> you can think of them as commas
				and
				as such
				they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel
				adventurous
				I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel
				them
				as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience
				and
				they are put there just for practical purposes. <strong>;</strong> and colons had for me from the first
				completely this
				character the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and
				definitely I
				have never used them. But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in
				them something of the character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use them. I really
				do
				not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than
				period
				and so really I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious
				than
				a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally
				within
				them the comma nature. And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about
				them.
